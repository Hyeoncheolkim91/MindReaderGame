# MindReaderGame

This is a small game that calculates a user's whole number less or equal to 63 throughout a series of questions.
To Run the game you need to have MARS; we use version 4.5. Make sure all the files posted here are in the same folder. Then, under MARS settings make sure that the following option is marked: "Assemble all files in directory", this will allow MARS to use the MACROS file and any other file that the program may include and need to be run.

# Set-up
1.	All files must be in the same folder to be used in MARS MIPS environment
2.	The MARS compilation mode must be set to Assemble all files in directory
3.	Think of a number between 0-63
Game Play
1.	The program will prompt if you’re ready to play the game. If you select no the game will wait for you to be ready, cancel will end the program, and selecting yes will start the game.
2.	After you start the game the console will show you a “card” containing a series of numbers. If the number you thought of is on the card then select yes on the dialogue box that will appear. If the number is not select on the card select no on the dialogue box that will appear.
3.	Repeat step 2 for each card that appears until your number is displayed in console!
